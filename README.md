### Plan
1. Predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes by performaing linear regression analysis. 
2. Collect statistics on the suspension Coils PSI
3. Run T-tests to compare the manufactoring lots vs the mean population

## Linear regression to Predict MPG
To predict the MPG of MechaCar prototypes a linear regression was performed and the code can be found in
